# About me

Hello! I am a MS student at USC, advised by Swabha Swa­yam­dip­ta. Previously, I was a Research Engineer at Retrocausal, and before that I studied EECS at NUST. 
My current research focuses on improving language modeling, sampling, and interpretability methods by building and exploiting our theoretical understanding of neural language models.
