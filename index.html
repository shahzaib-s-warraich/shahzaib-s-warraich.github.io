  One of the most striking findings in modern research on large language models (LLMs) is that scaling up compute during training leads to better results. However, less attention has been given to the benefits of scaling compute during inference. This survey focuses on these inference-time approaches. We explore three areas under a unified mathematical formalism: token-level generation algorithms, meta-generation algorithms, and efficient generation. Token-level generation algorithms, often called decoding algorithms, operate by sampling a single token at a time or constructing a token-level search space and then selecting an output. These methods typically assume access to a language model's logits, next-token distributions, or probability scores. Meta-generation algorithms work on partial or full sequences, incorporating domain knowledge, enabling backtracking, and integrating external information. Efficient generation methods aim to reduce token costs and improve the speed of generation. Our survey unifies perspectives from three research communities: traditional natural language processing, modern LLMs, and machine learning systems.

<p>The commercialization of large language models (LLMs) has led to the
common practice of high-level API-only access to proprietary models. In
this work, we show that even with a conservative assumption about the
model architecture, it is possible to learn a surprisingly large amount
of non-public information about an API-protected LLM from a relatively
small number of API queries (e.g., costing under $1,000 for OpenAI’s
gpt-3.5-turbo). Our findings are centered on one key observation: most
modern LLMs suffer from a softmax bottleneck, which restricts the model
outputs to a linear subspace of the full output space. We show that this
lends itself to a model image or a model signature which unlocks several
capabilities with affordable cost: efficiently discovering the LLM’s
hidden size, obtaining full-vocabulary outputs, detecting and
disambiguating different model updates, identifying the source LLM given
a single full LLM output, and even estimating the output layer
parameters. Our empirical investigations show the effectiveness of our
methods, which allow us to estimate the embedding size of OpenAI’s
gpt-3.5-turbo to be about 4,096. Lastly, we discuss ways that LLM
providers can guard against these attacks, as well as how these
capabilities can be viewed as a feature (rather than a bug) by allowing
for greater transparency and accountability.</p>

<p>Despite their ubiquity in language generation, it remains unknown why
truncation sampling heuristics like nucleus sampling are so effective.
We provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of the
truncation sampling by proving that truncation methods that discard
tokens below some probability threshold (the most common type of
truncation) can guarantee that all sampled tokens have nonzero true
probability. However, thresholds are a coarse heuristic, and necessarily
discard some tokens with nonzero true probability as well. In pursuit of
a more precise sampling strategy, we show that we can leverage a known
source of model errors, the softmax bottleneck, to prove that certain
tokens have nonzero true probability, without relying on a threshold.
Based on our findings, we develop an experimental truncation strategy
and the present pilot studies demonstrating the promise of this type of
algorithm. Our evaluations show that our method outperforms its
threshold-based counterparts under automatic and human evaluation
metrics for low-entropy (i.e., close to greedy) open-ended text
generation. Our theoretical findings and pilot experiments provide both
insight into why truncation sampling works, and make progress toward
more expressive sampling algorithms that better surface the generative
capabilities of large language models.</p>

<p>When pretrained language models (LMs) are applied to discriminative
tasks such as multiple-choice questions, they place probability mass on
vocabulary tokens that aren’t among the given answer choices. Spreading
probability mass across multiple surface forms with identical meaning
(such as”bath”and”bathtub”) is thought to cause an underestimation of a
model’s true performance, referred to as the”surface form
competition”(SFC) hypothesis. This has motivated the introduction of
various probability normalization methods. However, many core questions
remain unanswered. How do we measure SFC? Are there direct ways of
reducing it, and does doing so improve task performance? We propose a
mathematical formalism for SFC which allows us to quantify and bound its
impact for the first time. We identify a simple method for reducing it –
namely, increasing probability mass on the given answer choices by a)
including them in the prompt and b) using in-context learning with even
just one example. We show this method eliminates the impact of SFC in
the majority of instances. Our experiments on three diverse datasets and
six LMs reveal several additional surprising findings. For example, both
normalization and prompting methods for reducing SFC can be ineffective
or even detrimental to task performance for some LMs. We conclude with
practical insights for effectively prompting LMs for multiple-choice
tasks.</p>

<p>Few-shot prompting is a surprisingly powerful way to use Large
Language Models (LLMs) to solve various tasks. However, this approach
struggles as the task complexity increases or when the individual
reasoning steps of the task themselves are hard to learn, especially
when embedded in more complex tasks. To address this, we propose
Decomposed Prompting, a new approach to solve complex tasks by
decomposing them (via prompting) into simpler sub-tasks that can be
delegated to a library of prompting-based LLMs dedicated to these
sub-tasks. This modular structure allows each prompt to be optimized for
its specific sub-task, further decomposed if necessary, and even easily
replaced with more effective prompts, trained models, or symbolic
functions if desired. We show that the flexibility and modularity of
Decomposed Prompting allows it to outperform prior work on few-shot
prompting using GPT3. On symbolic reasoning tasks, we can further
decompose sub-tasks that are hard for LLMs into even simpler solvable
sub-tasks. When the complexity comes from the input length, we can
recursively decompose the task into the same task but with smaller
inputs. We also evaluate our approach on textual multi-step reasoning
tasks: on long-context multi-hop QA task, we can more effectively teach
the sub-tasks via our separate sub-tasks prompts; and on open-domain
multi-hop QA, we can incorporate a symbolic information retrieval within
our decomposition framework, leading to improved performance on both
tasks.</p>

<p>Mathematical reasoning skills are essential for general-purpose
intelligentsystems to perform tasks from grocery shopping to climate
modeling.Towards evaluating and improving AI systems in this domain, we
proposeLILA, a unified mathematical reasoning benchmark consisting of 23
diversetasks along four dimensions:(i) mathematical abilities e.g.,
arithmetic, calculus (ii) language format e.g., question-answering,
fill-in-the-blanks (iii) language diversity e.g., no language, simple
language (iv) external knowledge e.g., commonsense, physics. We
construct our benchmark by extending 20 datasets benchmark by collecting
task instructions and solutions in the form of Python programs,thereby
obtaining explainable solutions in addition to the correct answer.We
additionally introduce two evaluation datasets to measure
out-of-distribution performance and robustness to language
perturbation.Finally, we introduce BHASKARA,a general-purpose
mathematical reasoning model trained on LILA. Importantly, we find that
multi-tasking leads to significant improvements (average relative
improvement of 21.83% F1 score vs. single-task models),while the best
performing model only obtains 60.40%,indicating the room for improvement
in general mathematical reasoning and understanding.</p>

<p>The instruction learning paradigm—where a model learns to perform new
tasks from task descriptions alone—has become popular in research on
general-purpose models. The capabilities of large transformer models as
instruction learners, however, remain poorly understood. We use a
controlled synthetic environment to characterize such capabilities.
Specifically, we use the task of deciding whether a given string matches
a regular expression (viewed as an instruction) to identify properties
of tasks, instructions, and instances that make instruction learning
challenging. For instance, we find that our model, a fine-tuned T5-based
text2text transformer, struggles with large regular languages,
suggesting that less precise instructions are challenging for models.
Instruction executions that require tracking longer contexts of prior
steps are also difficult. We use our findings to systematically
construct a challenging instruction learning dataset, which we call Hard
RegSet. Fine-tuning on Hard RegSet, our large transformer learns to
correctly interpret (with at least 90% accuracy) only 65.6% of test
instructions, and 11%-24% of the instructions in out-of-distribution
generalization settings. We thus propose Hard RegSet as a challenging
instruction learning dataset, and a controlled environment for studying
instruction learning.</p>

<p>Targeted syntactic evaluations have demonstrated the ability of
language models to perform subject-verb agreement given difficult
contexts. To elucidate the mechanisms by which the models accomplish
this behavior, this study applies causal mediation analysis to
pre-trained neural language models. We investigate the magnitude of
models’ preferences for grammatical inflections, as well as whether
neurons process subject-verb agreement similarly across sentences with
different syntactic structures. We uncover similarities and differences
across architectures and model sizes—notably, that larger models do not
necessarily learn stronger preferences. We also observe two distinct
mechanisms for producing subject-verb agreement depending on the
syntactic structure of the input sentence. Finally, we find that
language models rely on similar sets of neurons when given sentences
with similar syntactic structure.</p>
