          Hello! I am a MS student at USC, advised by Swabha Swa­yam­dip­ta. Previously, I was a Research Engineer at Retrocausal. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My current research focuses on improving language modeling, sampling, and interpretability methods by building and exploiting our theoretical understanding of neural language models.

                  Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are among the most focused research in this century. Actually, autonomous driving provides very advanced tasks in terms of road safety monitoring which include identifying dangers on the road and  protecting  pedestrians.  In  the  last  few   years,   deep  learning (DL) approaches and especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been extensively  used  to  solve  ITS  problems  such  as  traffic  scene  semantic segmentation  and  traffic  signs  classification.  Semantic  segmentation  is  an important  task  that  has  been  addressed  in computer  vision (CV).  Indeed, traffic scene semantic segmentation using CNNs requires high precision with few computational resources to perceive and segment the scene in real-time. However,  we  often  find related  work  focusing  only  on  one  aspect,  the precision,  or  the  number  of  computational  parameters.  In  this  regard,  we propose RBANet, a robust and lightweight CNN which uses a new proposed balanced attention module, and a new proposed residual module. Afterward, we have simulated our proposed RBANet using three loss functions to get the best combination using only 0.74M parameters. The RBANet has been evaluated on CamVid, the most used dataset in semantic segmentation, and it has performed  well in terms of parameters’ requirements and precision compared to related work
